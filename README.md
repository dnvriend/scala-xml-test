# scala-xml-test
A small study project on [scala-xml](https://github.com/scala/scala-xml)

## Introduction
Since Scala 2.11, this library is a separate jar that can be omitted from Scala projects that do not use XML, so
if you do XML in Scala code, you should include this library.

The API is available [here](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala-xml/).
